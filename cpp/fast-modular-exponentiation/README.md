# Fast Modular Expoentiation

This algorithm calculates result when a number(a) is raised to power(b) and it's modulas is taken and result(R) is generated that is:

    R = (a^b) % m

It is fairly easy to calculate R but is quite dificult(very) to calculate b when R, a, m is known, and thus this one way property of this eequation make it useful in public-key cryptografhy.
